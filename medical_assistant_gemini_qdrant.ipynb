              "\"Carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in epithelial cells.  Epithelial cells line the surfaces of your body, including your skin, the lining of your organs, and your body cavities. \\n\\nHere's a breakdown:\\n\\n**What it is:**\\n\\n* **Cancer type:** Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 80-90% of all cancers.\\n* **Cell origin:** It originates in epithelial cells. These cells are responsible for covering surfaces and forming linings in your body.\\n* **Growth and spread:** Carcinoma cells grow abnormally and can invade nearby tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, a process known as metastasis.\\n\\n**Different Types of Carcinoma:**\\n\\nThere are many different types of carcinoma, named after the specific type of epithelial tissue where they originate. Some examples include:\\n\\n* **Squamous cell carcinoma:** Arises from squamous cells, which are flat, thin cells found in the skin, mouth, and other areas.\\n* **Adenocarcinoma:** Develops in glandular tissue, which produces and secretes substances like hormones or mucus.\\n* **Basal cell carcinoma:** A type of skin cancer that arises in the basal layer of the epidermis.\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\n\\nSymptoms of carcinoma vary depending on the type and location of the tumor. However, some common signs may include:\\n\\n* **Lumps or growths:** A new or unusual bump or growth on the skin or in other tissues.\\n* **Changes in skin:** Changes in skin color, texture, or appearance, such as sores that don't heal, unusual moles, or skin that becomes thickened or scaly.\\n* **Bleeding:** Unusual bleeding or discharge from any part of the body.\\n* **Pain:** Pain or discomfort in a specific area.\\n* **Weight loss:** Unexplained weight loss.\\n\\n**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\\n\\nDiagnosing carcinoma typically involves:\\n\\n* **Medical history and physical exam:** Your doctor will ask about your health history and perform a physical exam to look for any suspicious signs.\\n* **Imaging tests:**  X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds can be used to visualize tumors and assess their size and location.\\n* **Biopsy:**  A small sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis.\\n\\nTreatment options for carcinoma depend on the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as your overall health.  Common treatments include:\\n\\n* **Surgery:** Removing the cancerous tumor.\\n* **Radiation therapy:** Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\\n* **Chemotherapy:** Using drugs to destroy cancer cells.\\n* **Targeted therapy:** Using drugs that specifically target cancer cells and leave healthy cells unharmed.\\n* **Immunotherapy:**  Boosting the body's natural defenses to fight cancer.\\n\\n**Important Note:**\\n\\nIt's crucial to remember that this information is for general knowledge purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. If you suspect you have any signs or symptoms of cancer, please consult with your doctor immediately. \\n\""

Background Although the susceptibility of the developing fetus to various chemical exposures is well documented, the role of environmental chemicals in childhood brain cancer etiology is not well understood.   Objectives We aimed to evaluate whether mothers of childhood brain cancer cases had greater potential residential exposure to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals than control mothers during pregnancy.   Methods We included 382 brain cancer cases diagnosed at < 10 years of age from 1993 through 1997 who were identified from four statewide cancer registries. One-to-one matched controls were selected by random-digit dialing. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted. Using residential history of mothers during pregnancy, we measured proximity to TRI facilities and exposure index, including mass and chemicals released. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression to estimate brain cancer risk associated with TRI chemicals.   Results Increased risk was observed for mothers living within 1 mi of a TRI facility (OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.11-2.48) and living within 1 mi of a facility releasing carcinogens (OR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05-2.82) for having children diagnosed with brain cancer before 5 years of age, compared to living > 1 mi from a facility. Taking into account the mass and toxicity of chemical releases, we found a nonsignificant increase in risk (OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 0.67-2.34) comparing those with the lowest versus highest exposure index.   Conclusions Risk of childhood brain cancers may be associated with living near a TRI facility; however, this is an exploratory study and further studies are needed.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy population\\nSubjects who participated in the U.S. Atlantic Coast childhood brain cancer\\nstudy, a population-based case-control study of environmental\\nrisk factors (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2004), were eligible for the TRI study. Briefly, cases eligible for the original\\nAtlantic coast childhood brain cancer study included all incident\\ncases of first primary brain cancer [International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2) (World Health Organization 1990) codes C71.0-C71.9 including all morphologic codes with a behavior\\ncode of 3, excluding lymphomas] (Percy et al. 1990) diagnosed at < 10 years of age between 1993 and 1997, born in the\\nUnited States, and a resident of one of the four states (Florida, New\\nJersey, New York excluding New York City, and Pennsylvania) at the time\\nof diagnosis. In addition, an eligible case had to have the biological\\nmother available for an interview in English and a telephone in the\\nhousehold. During the computer-assisted telephone interview, a standardized\\nscreening questionnaire was used to verify eligibility and obtain\\nmothers\\' consent to participate in the study. The study protocol\\nwas approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\\nfour state institutional review boards. The four statewide cancer registries\\ninitially identified 937 case children. Eligibility screening\\ninterviews were not completed for 228: three (0.3%) physician\\nrefusals, two (0.2%) out-of-state children, 176 (18.8%) unable\\nto be traced, 39 (4.2%) mother refusals, and eight (0.9%) with\\nlanguage barriers. Of the 709 case children for whom\\nscreening interviews were completed, 662 met the eligibility criteria, and 535 mothers\\nof the 662 agreed to participate. Of the 535, nine\\nwere excluded because of difficulties in finding matched controls, and 526 were\\nincluded in the original study (56.1% of the originally\\nidentified 937 cases or 79.5% of the 662 eligible case children).\\nPotential controls in the original study were identified from the study\\nbase population through random-digit dialing (RDD) (Wacholder et al. 1992; Waksberg 1978). Eligible controls had to be born in the United States, be free of cancer, have\\nthe biological mother available for an interview in English, and\\nhave a telephone in the household. An equal number of controls were\\nselected by matching individually to cases on sex, race (white, black, or\\nother), birth year (+- 1 year), and state of residence\\nat the time of cases\\' diagnosis. The age at diagnosis of each\\ncase was used as a reference age for the corresponding control. Among\\nthe 20,802 RDD numbers prescreened for nonworking and nonvoice numbers, each\\nof 3,553 (17.1%) households had a child meeting the eligibility\\ncriteria for the control selection. Of the 3,553 children, 820 (23.1%) met\\nthe matching criteria. Of the 820 meeting the matching\\ncriteria, 122 did not have a matching case available, 102 mothers\\nrefused to participate, and 526 agreed to participate (2.5% of\\nthe 20,802 working residential numbers or 83.8% of the 628 eligible\\ncontrol children for whom a matching case child was available).\\nThis TRI study included 764 subjects (382 case-control pairs) of\\nthe 1,052 (526 case-control pairs) participants in the original\\nstudy: 222 subjects born before 1988 were excluded because the reporting\\nof TRI information began in 1987; 34 subjects who had incomplete\\npregnancy residential information or dates of residence were excluded; 32 subjects\\nmissing their matched case or control counterparts were\\nexcluded.\\nComputer-assisted telephone interview\\nThe biological mothers of cases and controls were interviewed in English\\nusing a computer-assisted telephone interview system. Bilingual (Spanish) interviewers\\nwere available. Mothers were asked to provide information\\non residential history of the parents and child from 24 months\\nbefore the child\\'s birth until the age of diagnosis or reference\\nage (i.e., age at diagnosis for counterpart case) for controls. Interviewers\\nwere instructed to obtain residential addresses and to take\\nnearest intersecting street names when the street numbers were unavailable. The\\nquestionnaire also included information on demographic characteristics\\nand on mothers\\' smoking habits during pregnancy.\\nExposure assessment\\nAddresses of mothers during pregnancy for the 10 months before birth were\\ngeocoded with latitude and longitude coordinates using GeoCoder (version 3.4b; GeoAccess\\nInc., Lenexa, KS). This software package was used\\nwith the TRI facilities\\' geographic coordinates to determine\\nexact distances from each residence to all facilities within a 2-mi radius. We\\ngeocoded 624 of 928 (67.2%) pregnancy addresses in the\\nfirst round. We located 288 of 928 (31%) unable to be geocoded\\nin the first round because of invalid addresses or zip codes using\\ndatabase records, public records, court records, and calls to post offices; these\\nwere gecoded in the second or third round. A total of 912 of 928 (98.3%) pregnancy addresses were successfully geocoded.\\nWe extracted the TRI data from the U.S. EPA TRI CD-ROM containing information\\nfor the years 1987-1997 (U.S. EPA 2000). To assess the quality of geocoded data obtained from the TRI database, we\\nrandomly selected approximately 5% of the TRI facilities\\' addresses\\nused in this study and matched those to addresses\\non the Streetmap 2000 street layer residing on the spatial data engine\\nusing ArcGIS (version 8.1; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, WA). Distance measurements for both were calculated. The\\nrange of difference was between 0.017 and 0.534 mi, with a mean value\\nof 0.3455 mi (0.060, 0.119, 0.343 mi for 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles\\nrespectively). The original plan to use the 0.5-mi radius or cutoff\\npoint as a potential exposure category was abandoned because these\\ndistances were deemed unstable. We retained the 1.0-mi and 2.0-mi radii\\nas proximity measures.\\nWe calculated the distance from the mother\\'s residence during any\\npoint in pregnancy to the nearest TRI facility and categorized the\\nexposure levels as residing <= 1 mi versus > 1 mi, and <= 2 mi\\nversus residing > 2 mi of any facility. Next, we investigated\\nwhether any carcinogen was released to the air from facilities within 1 mi\\nversus > 1 mi and within 2 mi versus > 2 mi of any facility. The\\nTRI air emissions of any class of carcinogens were categorized\\nas dichotomous variables without regard to the amount released to\\nthe air. Air emissions included stack and fugitive air releases. Carcinogens\\nas defined by the U.S. EPA included all known, probable, and possible\\nhuman carcinogens (U.S. EPA 2002a); EPCRA section 313 lists toxic chemicals that meet the Occupational Safety\\nand Health Administration carcinogen standard and are associated\\nwith the 0.1% de minimis concentration limit when in a mixture (U.S. EPA 2002a).\\nFinally, we chose a hazard-screening tool for exposure assessment. To comparatively\\nrank TRI chemical releases, we adapted the chronic toxicity\\nindex developed by the U.S. EPA\\'s Region III (Neumann et al. 1998). The screening tool uses the TRI databases combining toxicity factors\\nand total mass to estimate the relative hazards of TRI chemical releases\\nwith a separate algorithm for carcinogens and noncarcinogens. For\\ncarcinogens, the carcinogenic weight of evidence (WOE) and cancer potency\\nfactors (CPF) and the pounds of chemicals released are included in\\nthe index calculation. The WOE data were obtained from the Integrated\\nRisk Information System (U.S. EPA 2002b), a database of human health effects that may result from exposure to\\nenvironmental substances. We used the U.S. EPA Region II Risk-Based-Concentration\\nTable (U.S. EPA 2002a) to obtain the CPF for the inhalation or ingestion routes of exposure. Although\\nthe likely exposure route would be through the inhalation route, chemicals\\nwith only oral CPF were included in the index using the\\noral CPF value.\\nWe modified the chronic toxicity index to include the duration of residence\\nand the distance to the TRI facility. With some subjects\\' pregnancy\\nperiod spanning 2 calendar years, duration of residence at\\neach address during pregnancy for each calendar year was calculated separately\\nto match it with the appropriate year-specific TRI data. Because\\nthe TRI data report the total amount of emissions during a calendar\\nyear, the number of months a woman lived at a particular address for\\nthe particular year while pregnant was divided by 12 months and then\\nmultiplied into the chronic toxicity index. Only known, probable, and\\npossible carcinogens, as defined by the U.S. EPA (2002a), that were released within 2 mi of pregnancy residence and having the\\nappropriate carcinogenic WOE and CPF information available were included. We\\nincorporated the duration of exposure, and residential distance\\nto the facilities to the chronic toxicity index:\\nStatistical analysis\\nWe used conditional logistic regression analyses to achieve maximum likelihood\\nestimates of ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for\\nthe exposure variables. Exposure variables for residential proximity\\nand residing near a facility releasing carcinogens were categorized as <= 1 mi\\nversus > 1 mi, and <= 2 mi versus > 2 mi. We\\ncategorized the exposure index into three levels using the following\\ncut-point values: zero; greater than zero but less than median index\\nvalue among controls; and greater than median index value among controls. The\\npotential confounders examined included mother\\'s education, household\\nincome level, and mother\\'s pregnancy age. Because\\nthere were no substantial confounding effects from these variables, judged\\nby the change-inestimate methods (i.e., 10% change\\nin OR), unadjusted ORs are presented. Because it is possible that the\\neffect of potential gestational exposure may be more relevant to cancer\\ndevelopment in earlier childhood or to particular histological subtype\\nof childhood brain cancer, we repeated the analysis by reference age (< 5 and >= 5 years) and by two major histological subtypes, primitive\\nneuroectodermal tumors (PNET) and astrocytomas [ICD-O-2 codes 9400-9441 and 9470-9473, respectively (Percy et al. 1990)]. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 8.02; SAS\\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC).\\n\\nResults\\nDemographics and histopathologic characteristics of the study population\\nTable 1 shows the distribution of the histopathologic types of the brain tumor\\namong cases and controls. Most of the case and control children were\\nwhite (88%); 11% were black and only 1.6% were\\nclassified as other. There were 233 pairs (61%) with a reference\\nage (age at diagnosis for cases) of < 5 years. Most of the children (72%) were\\nborn before 1993. The distribution of mothers\\' age\\nat pregnancy was similar in cases and controls (Table 1). Case mothers\\' education levels were slightly higher than control\\nmothers\\' education levels, but the household income levels\\nwere slightly higher for the controls. Astrocytomas were the most common\\ntype; about half the cases had astrocytomas whereas 29% had\\nPNETs (Table 2).\\nOverall, 635 case and control mothers lived at one address for the entire\\npregnancy. The remaining 129 (17%) mothers had lived at more\\nthan one address during pregnancy: 121 mothers with two and eight with\\nthree addresses. The resulting total was 901 addresses. Mothers\\' residences\\nduring pregnancy were located in 23 different states\\nfor the case mothers and 18 different states for control mothers. However, 94% of\\nboth case and control mothers lived during the entire\\npregnancy in one of the four states--Florida, New Jersey, New\\nYork (excluding New York City), or Pennsylvania.\\nResidential proximity to TRI facilities during pregnancy\\nWe identified a total of 1,624 different TRI facilities within 2 mi of\\nany of the case and control residences. The case mothers had a higher\\nfrequency of living within 1 and 2 mi of any TRI facility than control\\nmothers at any point during pregnancy. Table 3 shows the results of analyses comparing cases and controls living within 1 mi\\nversus > 1 mi from TRI facilities and living within 2 mi versus > 2 mi. Living\\nwithin 1 mi of any TRI facilities during pregnancy\\nshowed slightly increased OR for all reference ages (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.96-1.80) and a statistically significant OR for\\nthose < 5 years of age at diagnosis (OR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.11-2.48) compared\\nto living > 1 mi. For living within 1 mi versus > 1 mi\\nfrom a TRI facility releasing carcinogens, the OR was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.01-2.17) for all ages, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.05-2.82) for those < 5 years of age at diagnosis. Analysis\\nby tumor types, astrocytoma and PNET, was associated with increased\\nrisk estimates, but the results were not statistically significant (Table 4). For astroycytoma, living within 1 mi of any TRI facility had an OR of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.77-1.82) compared to living > 1 mi\\nfrom any facility, and living within 1 mi of a facility releasing carcinogens\\nhad an OR of 1.32 (95% CI, 0.79-2.22) compared\\nto living > 1 mi from a facility releasing carcinogens.\\nExposure index\\nOf 193 TRI compounds classified as known, probable, or possible carcinogens, 55 compounds\\nwere actually released within 2 mi of residences of\\nthe study population during pregnancy. From those 55 compounds, we obtained\\ninformation on 26 compounds and calculated the exposure indices\\nfor them. The most common compounds released within 2 mi of residence\\nfor individuals in the study population were dichloromethane, nickel\\nand nickel compounds, styrene, lead, trichloroethylene (TCE), formaldehyde, and\\ndi(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Compounds with the highest exposure\\nindex values for residential addresses were 1,3-butadiene, ethylene\\noxide, dichloromethane, chloroform, and vinyl chloride.\\nThere was an increasing risk trend as the exposure index level increased\\nfor those with a reference age of < 5 years: Compared to subjects\\nwith an exposure index of zero, the ORs were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.67-2.28) for\\nsubjects with an exposure index of greater than zero\\nand less than the median and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.67-2.34) for\\nsubjects with an exposure index of greater than the median (Table 5). However, the increasing trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.38). No increasing trend in risks for two major subtypes of\\nbrain cancer, astrocytoma and PNETs, was observed by the increasing\\nexposure index level (Table 6).\\nBecause some of the carcinogens did not have the appropriate toxicity information, a\\nseparate analysis was conducted by calculating the exposure\\nindex only with the mass of compounds released, duration at each residence, and\\ndistance to the facility. However, the results did not differ\\nand elevated risk was not observed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nEnvironmental epidemiology studies constantly struggle with ways to assess\\npast exposure. Although a number of databases include information\\non the release of chemicals, these were collected mostly for regulatory\\npurposes and therefore lack the individual specificity desired for these\\nstudies. Nonetheless, it is important to try to use these data in\\ncreative ways if we are to have any information at all on past exposures. Because\\nof the uncertainty built into using these data, studies such\\nas this must be interpreted with caution. In this study we used data\\nfrom the TRI to assess exposure in three different ways: living within\\na specified distance of a TRI facility (1 or 2 mi), living within\\na specified distance of a TRI facility emitting a carcinogen (1 or 2 mi), and\\na toxicity index that took into consideration the toxicity of\\nthe chemical released and the duration of the exposure in addition to\\ndistance from a TRI facility. Actual individual exposure measures for\\nspecific chemicals were not available for this study.\\nWe observed an elevated risk for mothers living within 1 mi of a TRI facility\\nand living within 1 mi of a facility releasing carcinogens for\\nhaving children with brain cancer diagnosed before 10 years of age. The\\nodds ratios were higher for brain cancer cases diagnosed before age 5 years. For\\nthe exposure assessment using the exposure index, we observed\\nan increasing risk trend as the exposure index level increased, although\\nthe trend was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, since\\nthe number of subjects that actually had a positive exposure index\\nvalue was small, p-values would have been affected by the small sample size.\\nIt is not feasible to compare the results of this current analysis with\\nprevious studies because similar studies linking childhood brain cancers\\nwith TRI releases are not available. However, similar methods of exposure\\nassessment were used in previous studies on central nervous system\\nbirth defects from possible exposure to TRI sites (Croen et al. 1997; Marshall et al. 1997). Marshall et al. (1997) observed an increased risk for CNS defects associated with living within 1 mi\\nof a facility emitting either solvents or metals into the air; however, they\\ndid not observe a dose-response trend as distance\\nto TRI facilities was reduced. It is interesting that the 1-mi cutoff\\nfor exposure categorization resulted in significant risk for CNS defects (Marshall et al. 1997), but there was a lack of association when distance was further subcategorized\\nwithin 1 mi.\\nAlthough prenatal residential proximity to TRI facilities resulted in a\\nstatistically significant increased risk for childhood brain cancer, it\\nis imprudent to associate that with actual exposure to any compounds\\nreleased, so results should be interpreted accordingly. Several issues\\nconcerning exposure assessment must be taken into account. Some of\\nthe limitations of this analysis include concern over accuracy of residential\\nhistory data, limitations of the TRI data themselves, and methods\\nof exposure assessment.\\nResidential history information used in this analysis comprised self-reported\\nresponses from mothers of cases and controls. There is potential\\nfor recall and reporting bias that is further compounded by the fact\\nthat some subjects had to provide information dating back 10 years. Inaccurate\\naddress information for cases and controls that made it impossible\\nto assign geocoding information meant that distances to TRI facilities\\ncould not be determined, so that some cases and controls had to\\nbe excluded from the study. The concern here is selection bias, because\\nsubjects who were living in rural areas, less educated, or frequent\\nmovers may have been more likely to be excluded (Ward et al. 2000). However, only 11 of the 830 children born after 1988 were missing information\\non distance to TRI facilities, and 23 of the 830 children were\\nmissing mothers\\' pregnancy residential information, for a total\\nof only 34 of the 830 (4%), which is likely too small of\\na number to introduce such a bias.\\nAnother limitation of this study lies with the TRI data themsleves: They\\nare self-reports from companies and it is difficult to assess the accuracy\\nof the data. Facilities with < 10 full-time employees or those\\nnot meeting TRI quantity thresholds are not required to report releases. Thus\\nexposure experienced by both cases and controls may be higher\\nthan estimated through the TRI, because such facilities also may contribute\\nto the overall pollutant burden in the community. The variability\\nin exposure arising from these unreported emissions relative to those\\narising from TRI facilities is unknown. Also, chemical releases and\\nwaste generation are estimated and do not provide measurement of actual\\nconcentrations in the environment (Neumann et al. 1998).\\nFor the first two levels of analysis using proximity and the release of\\ncarcinogens, residing near multiple facilities or multiple compounds\\nreleased was not accounted for, although an attempt was made to include\\nthem in the exposure index. The exposure index has its own limitations\\nbecause not all the TRI compounds have a toxicity value necessary for\\nobtaining the chronic index. Several compounds lacked the inhalation\\ndata requiring oral toxicity factors to be used to estimate the index. However, preliminary\\nfindings suggest that substituting oral factors\\nfor inhalation did not change the final rank of TRI emission using the\\nchronic index approach (Neumann et al. 1998).\\nThis study did not account for other potential confounders such as mother\\'s\\nexposure to chemicals at the workplace during pregnancy. The\\nTRI is just one source of information on environmental releases. Other\\nsources of air pollution such as toxic emissions from cars or other\\nhazardous waste sites were not included. Only TRI air emissions data\\nwere extracted for the analysis, so we did not explore possible exposure\\nthrough contaminated drinking water. The pathway of exposure through\\ncontaminated drinking water is more difficult to assess for each individual; the\\nlocation of TRI sites may or may not have resulted in water\\ncontamination because municipal water wells are not directly related\\nto location of residences (Marshall et al. 1993). We would need to know whether private wells or municipal water wells\\nwere the principal source of water and determine if they were possibly\\ncontaminated by TRI chemical releases.\\nAlthough we used only the period of 10 months before birth, many mothers\\nand their children lived in the same residential address long after\\nbirth but these exposure data were not included in the analysis. Therefore, it\\nis difficult to rule out effects of potential exposure after\\nbirth. Further studies may be conducted to determine whether children\\nwho had lived at the same address from pregnancy to early childhood may\\nhave been exposed to further environmental chemical releases and possibly\\nhad a higher risk than those exposed only prenatally. Furthermore, because\\nthe TRI facilities report the annual releases and transfer\\nwithout indicating the specific time and date of the release, it is possible\\nthat the actual releases occurred outside of the 10-month pregnancy\\nperiod we examined.\\nThere are several strengths in this study. This is the only study to date\\nto examine the role of TRI releases and childhood brain cancer. In\\naddition, this study included a large number of cases and controls drawn\\nfrom the general population. We attempted to improve and build on previous\\nexposure assessment methods. Most previous studies such as those\\ndealing with environmental equity have compared populations using census\\ntracts and circular zones of different distances around hazardous\\nwaste sites and compared population characteristics within and outside\\nof those boundaries (Sheppard et al. 1999). Some have used ZIP-code boundaries (White and Aldrich 1999); however, ZIP codes have irregular boundaries, which do not indicate\\nany specific relation to the hazardous waste site. We used direct distance\\nto the TRI facilities and attempted to incorporate the amount as\\nwell as the toxicity of compounds released through the use of the chronic\\ntoxicity index.\\nMost published studies relied on the address on the birth certificate, which\\nmay not give a true picture of residence throughout the entire pregnancy. In\\nthis study we used residential addresses during pregnancy\\nthat were obtained from a survey question on residential history, rather\\nthan using the address at time of birth, and included multiple addresses\\nwhen applicable.\\nOur results suggest a possible relationship between living within 1 mi\\nof any TRI facility or a TRI facility emitting carcinogens during pregnancy\\nand a child\\'s later developing childhood brain cancer. However, there\\nare many uncertainties as to why such a relationship exists\\nand why the same relationship was not found for living within half\\na mi of a facility. Most of the limitations discussed would be expected\\nto bias the risk estimates toward the null and obscure any true association; however, it\\nis unclear how other limitations might affect the\\nrisk estimate.\\nDespite the inherent limitations in using these data for epidemiology studies, research\\nin this area needs to continue to refine their use. Further\\nstudies need to be conducted to explore whether these results can\\nbe replicated and also address and improve on some of the limitations\\ndescribed. Although this was a large study of childhood brain cancer\\nincluding > 300 cases and 300 controls, this study was not designed\\nto focus on specific chemicals because the number of cases and controls\\nwith potential to exposure specific carcinogens would be too small\\nto warrant meaningful analysis. Therefore, it is not possible to pinpoint\\nthe specific agents that may have increased the risk for brain cancer. There\\nis the potential for further improving on exposure assessment\\nmethods by using an exposure index using a larger sample size or\\nby obtaining more complete toxicity and exposure information for the compounds.\\n\\nCorrection\\nIn Table 2, the value for \"All other\" has been corrected from 17 (4.5), as\\npublished online, to 75 (19.6); in Table 5, the value for \"All reference ages\" exposure index level\\nII has been changed from 1.91 to 0.91.\\n'"
